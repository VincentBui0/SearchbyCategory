# SearchbyCategory
This project was made with C# and Microsoft Visual Studio. The program enables the user to search up certain lists of items according to their category(e.g. fruits, desserts, vegetables, etc.).
The images used in conjuction with this project were found via google images, and thus they had to be put in the same folder as the project. They had to be .jpgs otherwise it wouldn't add properly to the project.
